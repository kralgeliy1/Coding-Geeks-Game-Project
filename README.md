Welcome to Taxi Rush! 

This is a lane-changing racing game where you play as a taxi and move to avoid obstacles. With a total of 3-lives, you must maneuver around the everchanging-colourful shapes appearing before you. Once 3 lives are up, you are presented with a points score for how long you've lasted as well as the number of obstacles you've passed. Beware of a secret you won't find before playing!
